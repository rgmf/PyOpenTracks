# Short description
FIT segment encoder is a python software to create FIT segment files.

# Examples
In the `examples` folder you have a `main.py` file with a Python script that create a FIT segment file, and
it'll print a description of the contents of the just FIT segment file created. It uses
`python-fitparse` library, so you'll need install it to execute this example.

`python-fitparse` is here: https://github.com/dtcooper/python-fitparse
