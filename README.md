# PyOpenTracks
PyOpenTracks is a GTK/GNOME libre-software analytic project for activities (like biking, running, etc) recorded with applications like [OpenTracks](https://github.com/OpenTracksApp/OpenTracks) and exported to GPX.

In fact, this project is created with the goal of analyse the tracks I record with [OpenTracks](https://github.com/OpenTracksApp/OpenTracks), exported to GPX and synchronized through [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/).

At this moment it's in an active development status and it shouldn't be used for real purpose.

# Current features
This project is in an early stage so the current features are growing little by little.

Currently, the features are:
- Open a GPX file to see all stats and the track on a map.
- Import GPX files.
- Import folders (PyOpenTracks gets all GPX files and import all of them).
- Auto-import: you can set a folder where PyOpenTracks will see for new files to import every time it's opened.
- List of all GPX files imported with stats.
- Aggregated stats from all times and yearly/monthly stats.

# Develop, test, use, check it out...
If you want to check PyOpenTracks out, participate in the development... you can read [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) to has PyOpenTracks ready to execute and use.

# Name story
The name of this project is based on [OpenTracks](https://github.com/OpenTracksApp/OpenTracks) that is the app I use to record all my activities and the source of all my GPX files.
